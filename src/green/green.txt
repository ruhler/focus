green is a window manager for the consoler environment. It allows you to
switch between multiple running consoler applications.

green consists of two programs, sgreen and sgreen.

  sgreen [-s socketname]

sgreen starts a green server which listens for clients on a unix socket. The
socket name can be specified explicitly with the -s option, otherwise it
defaults to a name based on the user and process id for the sgreen process. In
either case, the environment variable GREENSVR will be set with the name of
this socket for client applications to connect to.

When sgreen starts it launches the first client based on the CNSLSHELL
environment variable, defaulting to "termer".

New clients can be launched by running the cgreen program.
  cgreen [-e] client [client args ..]

cgreen takes a client to launch and command line arguments for the client.
cgreen will connect to the server, launch the specified client, and then exit.
If the -e option is passed to cgreen, cgreen will not exit until the client
terminates.

green gives each client a full window. Only one client is viewed at a time.
The special sequence ctrl-' is used to send commands to green. The following
commands are supported

 ctrl-' 0-9     go to window corresponding to the digit pressed
 ctrl-' c       start a new shell based on the CNSLSHELL environment variable
