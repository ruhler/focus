green is a window manager for the consoler environment. It allows you to
switch between multiple running consoler applications.

green consists of two programs, sgreen and sgreen. sgreen starts a green
server which listens for clients on a unix socket whose name is based on the
user and process id for the sgreen process. The environment variable GREENSVR
will be set with the name of this socket for client applications to connect
to.

When sgreen starts it launches the first client based on the CNSLSHELL
environment variable, defaulting to "termer".

New clients can be launched by running the cgreen program.
  cgreen [-e] client [client args ..]

cgreen takes a client to launch and command line arguments for the client.
cgreen will connect to the server, launch the specified client, and then exit.
If the -e option is passed to cgreen, cgreen will not exit until the client
terminates.

green gives each client a full window. Only one client is viewed at a time.
The special sequence ctrl-' is used to send commands to green. The following
commands are supported

 ctrl-' 0-9     go to window 0-9
 ctrl-' c       start a new shell based on the CNSLSHELL environment variable
 ctrl-' w       show which windows are open and the currently viewed window
