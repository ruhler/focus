sgreen starts a green server which listens for clients on a unix socket.  The
socket name can be specified explicitly with the -s option, otherwise it
defaults to a name based on the user and process id for the sgreen process. In
either case, the environment variable GREENSVR will be set with the name of
this socket for client applications to connect to.

When sgreen starts it launches the first client based on the CNSLSHELL
environment variable, defaulting to `termer`.

New clients can be launched by running the cgreen program.

Green gives each client a full window. Only one client is viewed at a
time. Green has two modes. In insert mode, events are passed directly to the
currently visible client application. In green mode, green accepts the
following commands.

0-9:: Go to window corresponding to the digit pressed.
c:: Start a new shell based on the CNSLSHELL environment variable.
i:: Enter insert mode.
o:: Enter green mode.

The special sequence ctrl-' is used to execute one of the green commands in
insert mode. For example, +ctrl-' o+ can be used to enter green mode from
within insert mode, and +ctrl-' 2+ can be used to switch to window 2 from
insert mode while remaining in insert mode.
