sgreen starts a green server which listens for clients on a unix socket.  The
socket name can be specified explicitly with the -s option, otherwise it
defaults to a name based on the user and process id for the sgreen process. In
either case, the environment variable GREENSVR will be set with the name of
this socket for client applications to connect to.

When sgreen starts it launches the first client based on the CNSLSHELL
environment variable, defaulting to `termer`.

New clients can be launched by running the cgreen program.

Green gives each client a full window. Only one client is viewed at a
time.  The special sequence ctrl-' is used to send commands to green. The
following commands are supported

ctrl-' 0-9:: Go to window corresponding to the digit pressed.
ctrl-' c:: start a new shell based on the CNSLSHELL environment variable.
