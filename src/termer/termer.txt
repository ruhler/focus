termer is a terminal emulator consoler application. It attempts to emulate a
standard terminal as best it can. Termer supports utf8 unicode characters.

termer starts a shell based on the SHELL environment variable, defaulting to
/bin/sh. It gets the window size from CNSLWIDTH and CNSLHEIGHT, defaulting to
640x480. The font used is taken from the environment variable TERMERFONT,
which should be a fontconfig font name, such as `Monospace-20:Bold`, the
font defaults to `Monospace`. Termer will pack as many lines and columns
that fit into the window based on your chosen font.

The terminal type for termer is `termer`. A terminfo file is provided in the
source release. To install the terminfo entry, run `tic termer.ti`.
