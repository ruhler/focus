Filler is a consoler client which fills the screen with a solid color. The
color can be changed using appropriate key strokes. The primary motivation
of this application is to serve as a simple client for testing consoler
servers.

Filler initially fills the screen with black. You can then press any of the
following keys to fill the screen with the corresponding color.

[horizontal]
r:: red
g:: green
b:: blue
c:: cyan
y:: yellow
p:: purple
w:: white
n:: black

The following keys also do interesting things.

[horizontal]
q:: quit filler
d:: halve the size of the display filler fills
d:: double the size of the display filler fills

Normally filler reads consoler resize events to determine the size of the
display to fill. The 'd' key tells filler to use double the current dimensions
for the size of the display to fill and the 'h' key tells filler to use half
the current dimensions for the size of the display to fill. This is to make it
easy to test the case where a client sends too large or small a display.
