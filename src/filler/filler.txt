Filler is a consoler application which fills the screen with a different solid
color depending on what key you press.

Filler initially fills the screen with black. You can then press any of the
following keys to fill the screen with the corresponding color.

r     red
g     green
b     blue
c     cyan
y     yellow
p     purple
w     white
n     black     ('n' is for nothing)

To quit the application:
q     quit


Filler uses CNSLWIDTH and CNSLHEIGHT to determine the dimensions of the
screen, defaulting to 640x480.
