pdfer is a consoler application for viewing pdf files, based on libpoppler.

-------------------
pdfer FILE
-------------------

It takes a single command line argument specifying which pdf file to view.

The following key bindings are defined.

q:: quit the application
space, pagedown, n:: view the next page in the document
pageup, p:: view the previous page in the document
end:: view the last page in the document
home:: view the first page in the document
0-9:: append a digit to the accumulator
c:: clear the accumulator
g:: view the page specified by the accumulato.  For example, to go to page 27,
    you would type: "27g" The first page is page 1.
h:: scroll left 10% of the view
j:: scroll down 10% of the view
k:: scroll up 10% of the view
l:: scroll right 10% of the view
ctrl-h:: scroll left 1% of the view
ctrl-j:: scroll down 1% of the view
ctrl-k:: scroll up 1% of the view
ctrl-l:: scroll right 1% of the view
d:: scroll down 50% of the view
u:: scroll up 50% of the view
f:: scroll down 90% of the view
b:: scroll up 90% of the view
t:: scroll to the top of the current page
e:: scroll to the end of the current page
i:: zoom in 20%
o:: zoom out 20%
I:: zoom in 50%
O:: zoom out 50%
ctrl-i:: zoom in 10%
ctrl-o:: zoom out 10%
w:: fit the page to the width of the window
a:: fit the page to the entire window
r:: rotate the page 90 degrees clockwise
R:: rotate the page 90 degrees counterclockwise
v:: show information about the pdf file viewed and current page.
    This pops up a status bar which will go away at the next input.

Using cairo with poppler
------------------------
poppler's cpp interface, which pdfer uses, makes use of the splash backend
instead of the cairo backend. The cairo back end is higher quality however.
Included with the source of pdfer is a patch, poppler_cpp_cairo.patch,  which
can be applied to poppler 0.16.5 or later to use the cairo back end.
