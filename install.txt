Building and Installing Focus
=============================
To configure Focus for build, run:

   ./configure --prefix <PREFIX>

Where <PREFIX> is the desired installation prefix. It defaults to /usr/local.
This will generate the file config.tcl with the configuration options.

To build and install Focus, after configuration has been performed:

   make install

If you want to install the terminfo entry for the termer component, you should
also run tic src/termer/termer.ti.

Component Package Requirements
------------------------------

fonter:: freetype2, fontconfig
green:: none

pdfer:: freetype2, fontconfig, poppler-cpp

Additionally, asciidoc is needed to produce the documentation.

Please report any difficulties you encounter in building and installing focus.
Suggestions on how to make the install experience nicer are also welcome,
otherwise it will probably stay the way it is now.
