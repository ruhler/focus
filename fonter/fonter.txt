Fonter is a library which wraps fontconfig and freetype to make working
with fonts easier in consoler applications. A fonter object represents a
single font you can use to draw characters or strings of characters to
consoler displays.

To use the fonter library, include fonter.h and link with -lfreetype
-lfontconfig -lfonter

metrics.

After you have created a fonter object, you can load a specific glyph for
drawing.

Once a glyph is loaded, you can ask for its width and access the greyscale
rendering of the glyph.

Included with the fonter source is an fonterexample.c, which is an
example application which uses fonter. The application draws a string to
the screen and waits for the keystroke q before exiting.
