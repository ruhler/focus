Status update: we now have:
- boxer: a simple application using my graphics protocol
- pnger: a useful application using my graphics protocol
- green: a graphical screen like application for switching among other
  graphical applications using my protocol.

Now, admittedly all of these are a little raw, but certainly solid proofs of
concept.

So, what's next?

What's next is, to make this really useful, I need a terminal emulator using
my graphics protocol.

I could use fbterm, try to add an SDL layer, but I'd like to look into not
using SDL at all. It should be easily doable if I have some way to render the
ttf font outside of SDL, which I think is easily doable. I just have to find
the right library and how to use it.

The terminal emulator will force me to figure out a better escape sequence for
switching windows than 0-9. That will be an improvement. (Maybe alt-F1 through
alt-F9 to start?).

Then to make things useable I'll probably want a green application which
acts as sgreen or cgreen as necessary. And have sgreen close the /tmp/green
file when it finishes (maybe that won't be so much of a problem).

Then start using it. Everywhere I can. And make it better as desired.
And after that, it's a matter of adding applications to it.
Particularly desirable will be a pdf viewer (use a variant on gylf I think,
with libpoppler and cairo).

Ideally we could implement an xserver application, so I can run any X
application. That might actually be doable with xvfb? It's worth looking into.
That way I'll get firefox and inkscape, the other more important graphical
applications I use. Then I'll be all set.

Wow. This is cool. I'm excited.
