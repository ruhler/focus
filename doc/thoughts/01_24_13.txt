I have a network now, so time to do my tests.

1.  binding to LOOPBACK limits to local connections, as expected and desired.
Cool.

2. ssh -r works! Nifty.

So, everything is all set now, except... understanding why tcp doesn't work
locally.

Cool.

Now then... how to solve the local issues?

First, collect symptoms. Understand what happens where and when.

Let me focus on the pdfer issue.

Trying Christmas carol pdf files.

Under sgreen: first page loads, I can scroll down, switching to the next page
gives an assertion.

Under sdlcsr: works fine.

What's the difference?

Well, more observations on the failure: it's ...
Repeatable, yes: scroll forward, then next page. But I can get to other pages
if I do different 

consoler.c:280 is where the assertion fails. In CNSL_SendDisplay... who calls
that?

I suppose the first question is to ask, what is crashing? sdlcsr? sgreen?
cgreen? pdfer?

I need to think about this some.

It's got to be sgreen which is crashing.
