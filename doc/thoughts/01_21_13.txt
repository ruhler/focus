Well, I ran some experiments, without much in the way of positive results:

* INADDR_LOOPBACK doesn't seem to work. The server can't bind to it.
* INADDR_ANY allows external connections
* ssh with -R just doesn't seem to work, I don't know why.
* ssh with -L says it's not allowed.

Something stopped working. I don't understand. I can't run server/client
locally anymore. Reboot?

Aha! I think I got it to work.

After rebooting, and running
 ip set link lo up

Then on pacific: ./server  (listens on 5234)
Then on pacific: ssh -R 4433:localhost:5234 ruhler@greenfield.csail.mit.edu
/home/ruhler/projects/focus/rsrch/ssl/client (client attaches to 4433).

What did I do differently here? I enabled the lo interface on pacific. That
makes sense.

In other words... this is it. This is exactly what I need. Server turns into
sgreen. Client turns into cgreen. I need to make sure to turn on the lo
interface on my local machine. Then I can do ssh and everything will hopefully
work just as I want it to.

There is still this problem that anyone can connect to the server, when I only
want local people to connect to it. Can I do something about that?
