Task: Get poppler patch included in release

After fixing the rotation stuff I think the patch is as generally as it could
nicely be. I haven't found memory leaks. So I emailed the poppler mailing
list. Let's see what they say.

I haven't gotten a meaningful response yet. Still waiting...

Maybe I should find their bugzilla thing and try to submit my patch that way?
