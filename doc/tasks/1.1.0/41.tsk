Task: termer strands artifacts sometimes

Like when I first start screen, sometimes little white dots are left after the
opening notice.

And now on pacific in vim, I see if I write a 'w', then do an with the cursor
on that w, and type some stuff, it leaves a long trail of messed up.

I somehow suspect fonter width precision issues are at play. See the task for
1.1.0 on g and y being clipped (15.tsk).
