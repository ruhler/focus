Task: fonter out of bounds bug

It triggers sometimes at work, and now I've caught it when logging off a
remote connection to greenfield from in screen.

The problem is termer crashes. From gdb it appears we try to print the
character ... Um. I'm not sure what character it is. gdb is printing funny
stuff.

print c: 9492 L'\024'

Oh. It's 9492, but if you just look at the bottom 8 bits, it's hex 20.

The consequence of this is we try to draw a glyph where the bitmap_top (27) is
greater than the ascender (28). This puts top at -1, so we try to draw with y
= -1, but that's like 4 billion, out of range, seg fault.

Let me see if I can reproduce this. How? Well, here's the character that
caused us problems: 0x2514 = â””. Perhaps if I scroll it to the top of the
display it will cause termer to crash.

Yup! I can reproduce it that way.

So, really this is a bug in fonter.

My font is: Monospace-25:Bold. This should be easy to catch in a fonter test
case. Then I can try to understand what the problem is and what the fix is.

I caught it in a test case. I guess I have to fix it now.

The problem is the same as before. The metrics freetype gives can be off by a
pixel. To deal with the height problem I add 1 pixel to the max height. But
now the ascender seems to be too small?

Well, one thing I can do is verify we stay in bounds. That may slow things
down, but certainly the bug will go away. Is that the "right" solution? I'm
not sure there is a right solution.

Fonter should certainly gaurentee it doesn't try to draw outside the
width by height cell boundary. I think unless we want to pad lots of space
around each cell, the way to solve this is only draw pixels in bounds. And by
in bounds I mean within the width by height cell boundary.

left >= 0, width < width, top >= 0, height < height.

I bet this fixes my artifacts trouble too (41.tsk).

Well, I made the fix. The test case passes. Let me just visually verify
everything looks okay still.

Tue Jul 19 22:01:21 EDT 2011

Yup. Everything looks fine. Let me finally check that I can't manually
reproduce the bug.

Uh oh. The fix is bad. It doesn't render the character right. Let me fix that.
I'm not sure how automatically to test this fix unfortunately.

Okay. Now it's fixed right. Cool.

This task is done.
