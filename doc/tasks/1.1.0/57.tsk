Task: review and revise documentation

I fear my documentation is out of date. Go over it all to make sure it's not
out of date.

In particular, make sure we get:
 - resize events replace geometry
 - any new consoler functions (fill rect?)
 - add change list
 - sgreen modality thing?

All done. It looks decently in date now.
