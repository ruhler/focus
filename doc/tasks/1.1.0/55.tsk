Task: CNSL_RecvDisplay doesn't update width and height correctly.

In particular, if a client sends too large a display, CNSL_RecvDisplay sets
width and height to what the client sent, not to what was actually updated.
It's fairly clear from the documentation, however, that it should only say
what's updated (the rest is ignored).

This should be easy to test and fix.

Tested and fixed.
