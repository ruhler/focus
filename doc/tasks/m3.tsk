Task: Milestone 3: elinks and png images

Milestone 3 is to be able to run elinks (without X) and be able to select a
png image as a link, and have it pop up a new window with the png image that I
can see. I can't currently do this with fbterm out of X, so this will be an
achievement.

I need the following working components for this milestone:

1. PNG viewer - I already have this
2. Terminal Emulator
3. Green with better control sequence

So, let me focus on the terminal emulator next. Termer.

Termer, while admittedly in need of a little work, is still useable, so let's

using this terminal.
