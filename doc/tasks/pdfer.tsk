Task: Make a pdf viewer that uses the focus framework.

This should be relatively simple. The goal is a minimal pdf viewer that I can
use to give presentations from a computer without X11 installed.

I can steal everything from gylf. That is, we use poppler to draw to a cairo
surface, we copy that to our display buffer and update it and all that.

For the first version no need to display page numbers or have a textline or a
tcl interpreter. Though, come to think of it, I could have a tcl interpreter
if I wanted...

No, add that later. Start with the usual keybindings, focusing again for
presentations. I suggest for the first set:
- scroll: up, down, left, right
- zoom: in, out, width, page
- goto: next, previous
- quit

Should be plenty for a simple presentation.

I can just have a main loop which reads key inputs, processes them, then
updates the display.
