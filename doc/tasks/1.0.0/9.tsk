Task: Define pnger features for release 1.0.0

I use this rather rarely... Anyway, I think it can stay as simple as it will
for now. Which is, you give it a filename on the command line, it displays
that as a png, and you can quit with the q key. Nothing else to it.

I can document this all with a single man page.
