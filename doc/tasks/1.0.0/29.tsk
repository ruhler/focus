Task: tclsh or tclsh8.5?

The issue was I tried make on a different computer which didn't have tclsh8.5
installed, but it did have tclsh8.4, which worked just fine if I used that.

So how about this, change to tclsh, and it can use whatever version people
have.

The only problem is my local install doesn't have tclsh as an alias for
tclsh8.5. I can fix that locally.

Well, that was easy to fix.
