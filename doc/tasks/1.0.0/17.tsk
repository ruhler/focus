Task: sgreen doesn't read $CNSLSHELL like it should

This will make it more difficult to test sgreen. For example, I might want
filler to be the shell application so I don't have to bother with termer for
testing.

I should write a test case for this. Or rather, I should write a simple test
case for sgreen with filler that uses this mechanism, and when that fails, I
can then fix the issue.
