Task: understand all the difference formats a pixel buffer can take on.

That is, how many different ways can we represent a pixel?

TrueColor: red, green, blue, [alpha]
    Using N bits for each of red, green, blue

Indexed: we need an index specified somewhere.

Greyscale: red, green, blue all treated as equal


How does SDL support all this? It basically allows all of the above by
specifying the pixelformat with each surface.
