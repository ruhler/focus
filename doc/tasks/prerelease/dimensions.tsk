Task: A console client needs some way to know the screen dimensions.

For example, a pdf viewer should be able to go full screen, not some fixed
compiled in size.

Or, I suppose the size could be a command line argument to the client.

Anyway, I was thinking just have a resize event which includes the width and
height of the new screen.
